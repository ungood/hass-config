# HVAC package specification

- In this house, there are 4 Daikin heat exchanger units
    - 1 in each bedroom, 1 in the Living Room, and one in the Rec Room.
    - The unit in the guest bedroom and living room are ceiling units which include an air filter.
    - The units are controlled by faikout/faikin units over MQTT
    - Each unit can be individually controlled, but all units that are on must be using the same mode:
      - Auto
      - Heat
      - Cool
      - Dry
      - Fan
- I want, in priority order:
    - The fan to be used in the living room and guest bedroom if PM2.5 air quality is in the "Unhealthy" range.
    - All units to be in auto mode if the house is vacant.
    - Bedrooms to be cool during sleep hours.
    - Living areas to be auto mode during waking hours.
    - I would like the system to learn how long it takes to get to the desired temperature and start sleep/awake modes based on that temperature.
- Additionally, I want to be able to configure, via inputs:
    - Sleep hours
    - Sleep temperature
    - Awake temperature
    - An overall on/off setting for this automation.
